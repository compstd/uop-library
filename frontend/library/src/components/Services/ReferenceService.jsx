        One of the last functions of library and information centers are to
        disseminate the information across the globe. This function heavily
        depends on the existence of Reference Services. The central library not
        only provides this service by directing the research scholars towards
        its Reference collection but also assists them in finding relevant
        information from other External resources. Moreover, the faculty of the
        central library provides this help through email, calling and via the
        Chat Service.
